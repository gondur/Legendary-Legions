Summary:
It's turn-based strategy with fantasy theme and rpg-elements (e.g. leveling the units, and skills which you could raise).
Your mission is to destroy enemy's castle. You can be on good or bad side. A the moment game supports only 2 human player 
game, but in future we plan to add AI and network play. The gameplay is similar to this in Heroes of Might and Magic but 
it's much simpler of course.

You can add music to menu, and game by copying mp3 files into /Pliki_danych/Muzyka (walka=battle in polish)

Idea and copyrights:
All units have been taken from Celtic Legends (an old Amiga game), the concept is a hybrid of Celtic Legends
(it's not clone), Heroes of Might & Magic and Civilization :D . The dragon in menu and in interface is not ours 
too as well as music in trailer ;D. Hmmm what's more... the code is ours (but we won't public it yet and everything
is in polish so you won't understand it at all), the rest graphic are ours. Oh and sound when the unit is building
is not ours too. I think it's all about copyrights. The game is freeware, non-profit etc.
